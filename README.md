# Evaluation Metrics

## Confusion Matrix

- Measure and compare model performance quality of the classification
- Confusion Matrix
    - A table showing predicted vs. actual classes
    - Count how many examples fall into each combination
    - Basis for most metrics
- {BILD EINER CONFUSION MATRIX}

## Different metrics

- Reduce the confusion matrix into interpretable numbers

### Accuracy

- Overall correctness

```latex
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
```
